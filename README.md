#  Unity Post Processing Stack Classic (PPSC) v1.x

![GitHub Logo](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.1/Documentation/uploads/Main/PostProcessing-Stack-0.png)

The post-processing stack is an Ã¼ber effect that combines a complete set of effects into a single post-processing pipeline.<br>
This has a few advantages:<br>
- Effects are always configured in the correct order<br>
- It allows a combination of many effects into a single pass<br>
- All effects are grouped together in the UI for a better user experience

The post-processing stack also includes a collection of monitors and debug views to help you set up your effects correctly and debug problems in the output.
